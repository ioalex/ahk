# AutoHotkey Scripts

This is a growing collection of the AutoHotkey scripts I currently use.

This collection of scripts makes use of [FanaticGuru's](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=118) [AHK Startup](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=788&p=5942) script to run all other scripts as if they were one instance.
